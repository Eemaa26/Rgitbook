# Open Built Gitbooks

The `openGitbook` is a convenience function that will open the built Gitbook in the system's default web browser. The only parameter for this function is the directory where the Gitbook was generated, which defaults to the `_book` subdirectory of the current working directory.


```r
> openGitbook()
```
